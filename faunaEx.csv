Aphids,Aphis pomi DeGeer,"Apple, pear quince and other members of the family Rosaceae.","Apperance and Lyfecycle: The aphids usually live on the same host throughout the year (autoecious), overwintering as eggs placed on apple branches. In the spring the emerging aphids reproduce by parthenogenesis till autumn, when males and sexual females appear and mate. The threshold of development is around 6ºC; at 16-20ºC a generation requires about 12 days, and each female has a average of 70 progeny. As soon as the apple buds begin to spring out in spring, they cling white, black eggs and the small aphids move up to the buds where the nutritious leaves are developed. After planting their suction cord deep into one of the juices, these develop into adults, adolescent females.   The body of the apterous female is light to dark green, the antennae are yellow and the cauda and siphunculi are dark green to black. Alate females are mostly black, with a greenish abdomen; otherwise they are similar to the apterae. The length of the female body is 1.5-2.2 mm.","Visual counts are recommended for evaluating aphid population density on apple and pear at the appropriate times. Concentrations of pest eggs should be noted in autumn and observed for aphid emergence in early spring, especially on adventitious apple branches, which grow early and serve as feeding sites for A. pomi.","Attacks of green apple leaves are often noticed first when you see the lively traffic of ants running up and down the branches and tribes. If you lift the leaves and look at the underside, one might find the green lice somewhere.  The green apple leaves are often seen on young trees, where its suction gives curly leaves. Pale-green tubercles may arise on the young fruit. As the lice suck on the new shoots, excessive sugars are called ""honeydews"" that can give rise to soils of so-called fire-fighting fungi. The damage to the green apple leaf loop is usually quite limited to slightly curled shoots, in worst case growth arrests, so even under business conditions, stop doing any real fighting. Worse it is with the red apple leaf loop which causes fruit deformation, the so-called lice apples. The pest also transmits a plant virus. The economic importance of this pest in some area of Europe has declined in recent years due to being displaced by the spirea aphid, Aphis spiraecola Patch. In addition to apple trees, in Denmark trees and shrubs are attacked by the malignant. In addition, Pear (Pyrus), Tjørn (Crataegus oxyacantha), Røn (sorbus), Berries (Cotoneater) and Roses (pink) are mentioned as host plants for the green apple leaf loop. ","It has been suggested a simple methodology for different phenological periods, as well as economic thresholds for the main apple-infesting aphids in Western Europe. Pre-flowering is the most critical phase because early attacks of D. plantaginea during flowering can cause severe losses. The presence of A. pomi (or A. spiraecola) either on apple or pear can be tolerated at higher levels because its reproductive rate is lower and the aphid causes no direct injury to fruits; in summer, damage by this aphid is negligible. A. pomi can be tolerated up to a threshold of 8–10% of shoots infested during the most critical period in spring. The same thresholds can be used on pear against D. pyri and A. pomi or M. pyraria, respectively. ","Green apple leaveslus is not very harmful to apple trees. Therefore, it may often be advantageous for smaller attacks because these lice can be food for different animals.  Planting or leaving weed strips between apple rows encourages the populations of the generalist natural enemies of the apple aphid, such as predatory Chrysopidae, Cecidomyiidae, Coccinellidae, Hemiptera and Syrphidae, as well as spiders… If you later receive an attack of red apple leaflus, these are present from the start and can control the attack.","In early spring, field observations that should be regularly carried out will determine whether spraying is required. The pest can be controlled by white oils and by insecticidal soaps. ","The use of chemical pesticides is usually harmful to the natural control, as well as the effects of the animals. So, selective aphicides such as   pirimicarb (LFS Pirimicarb* and  Pirimor G*) not harmful to aphid predators, should be preferred.",,,"Conservation biological control refers to the use of indigenous predators and parasitoids, usually against native pests. In conservation biological control, various measures are implemented to enhance the abundance or activity of the natural enemies, including manipulation of the crop microclimate, creation of overwintering refuges, increasing the availability of alternative hosts and prey, and providing essential food resources such as flowers for adult parasitoids and predators as well as for pollinators. Establishment and protection of ecological infrastructures such as hedgerows and flower strips will increase plant diversity, and this diversity can in turn be a source of natural enemies which can provide biological pest control. With respect to plants for hedges and flower strips, research is needed to identify selective plants or plant mixtures which favour the beneficials over the pests for the selected crops. For apple, conservation biological control is a high priority as a first barrier against the diversity of pests attacking this crop. Further studies of the use of flower strips in conservation biological control in apple orchards and in open field strawberry are needed. "
Aphids,Aphis spiraecola Patch,"Moderately polyphagous species. Primary (winter) hosts are Spiraea spp. and Citrus spp. It has numerous secondary host plants, in well over 20 families, particularly in the Caprifoliaceae, Compositae, Rosaceae, Rubiaceae and Rutaceae. The aphid has a preference for woody plants of a shrubby growth habit. Citrus and apple are the most important crop hosts, although grapefruit is almost immune to attack.","Apperance: A. spiraecola is a relatively small aphid. Alatae are 1.2-2.2 mm and apterae 1.2-2.2 mm, with largest body sizes in the spring. Its body colour is bright greenish-yellow or yellowish-green to apple-green. It has a brown head, mainly pale legs and antennae, but siphunculi and cauda that are dark-brown to black. Alatae have a dark-brown head and thorax, and a yellowish-green abdomen with dusky lateral patches on each segment.",,"The feeding of the spirea aphid on young citrusfoliage in the spring causes severe, characteristic curling and deformation of young leaves and twigs. Blossoms and young fruit (especially of soft-skinned varieties) drop prematurely, and the trees may be stunted. The consequences of a secondary, autumnal peak in pest outbreak are usually less severe. In addition, infested trees are contaminated by the the pest’s abundant honeydew and subsequently-developing sootymold. The aphid is a vector of the citrus tristeza virus and other plant viruses. Young avocado trees also suffer from the pest, as do peach and apple trees, and many ornamentals. ",,"The spirea aphid is attacked by predatory Cecidomyiidae, Chrysopidae, Coccinellidae and Syrphidae. However, due to the pest’s short life cycle and sudden arrival and departure from citrus, these predators have little effect on the aphid’s populations. Some endoparasitoid Aphidiidae attack A. spirea, but seldom complete their development there in; the causative mechanism is unknown. Several entomopathogenic fungi also infect the aphid, but none of these natural enemies appear to reduce the pest’s damage.","Due to the fact that young trees are especially vulnerable to this pest, pest damage can be reduced by spraying only; such control activities should not be undertaken during khamsins. Carbamates, some organophosphates and acetamiprid control the spirea aphid. Ethion, parathion-ethyl, dimethoate, fenitrothion and propoxur are listed as suitable insecticides, but these active materials are not approved in Denmark for pear. Pirimicarb has also been recommended, particularly in the context of integrated control (LFS Pirimicarb*, Pirimor G*). Abroad, A. spiraecola has become resistant to a number of insecticides, including pirimicarb.",,,,
Aphids,Aphis sambuci  Linnaeus,Hosts: ,"Lifehistory: In the Middle east, for example, this pest reproduces only by viviparousparthenogenesis, each female giving birth to about 60 progeny when feeding on citrus foliage. At 25ºC the pest completes a generation within 7-10 days. The threshold of development is around 2.5ºC, which means that the pest develops during winter and could explain its rapid, almost sudden infestation of citrus groves in early spring. It was concluded that the optimal range of temperature for A. spiraecola population growth was 20-30°C. ",,"Like other aphids, the shelf leaf loop is highly specific, as it does not attack other plant species than shells. However, in the litterature it is mentioned that this aphid has been replaced by plants belonging to the stone brook family (Saxifraga). Here it is, however, to be found as rootless. This behavior, called host change, is found in a variety of other aphids. ",,"Fortunately, there are some utility insects, predators that are able to regulate the stock.  Aphis sambuci is strongly attended by ants, often Lasius niger, on both the primary and secondary host. On the secondary host Aphis sambuci colonies are usually tented over with earth by the ants. The large colonies sometimes attract large numbers of predators, despite the fact that Aphis sambuci contains toxic compounds. Some predators do tend to avoid it - for example Coccinella septempunctata avoids it except just after overwintering - although it will still consume Aphis sambuci (preferentially!) in the laboratory situation (Nedved & Salvucci, 2008 ). It is also not uncommon to find hoverfly larvae lurking in the middle of a Aphis sambuci colony consuming them avidly. Mariehøns, snortworms, gallows and larvae of gully eyes eat many shells. Also the birds, especially meisers, are quite happy with this fairly large aphid. ",,,"Spills with cold water can cause a lot of aphids to drain away. If you are very bothered by the loops you can completely choose to remove the bushes. Often, shelf in parcel hushaver is a bit too violent. Unfortunately, you miss the many delights that can be made from both flowers and berries and not forgetting shelf flutes.",,
Aphids,Dysaphis plantaginea (Passerini),Apple and plantain (Plantago lanceolate Linnaeus and Plantago major Linnaeus).,"Lifecycle: The shelf loop overcomes as eggs. In spring, these are adhered to females who immediately begin to give birth to kids. When the population grows, individuals are born with wing systems capable of flying to other shelf bushes.","Overwintering aphid populations, which occur in spots, are to be monitored as soon as buds begin to emerge, in early spring. Special attention should be paid to the early-growing adventitious apple branches.","The red apple leaf loop is pink to dark blue gray, covered in a white powdered wax coat. The pipes are black brown.  The lice can be confused with Dysaphis devecta , but their attack causes red-flared, chopped apple leaves, which does not make the red apple leaves.",Economic treshold: 1-2% of the spurs with attack before flowering,"A great amount of natural enemies are able to regulate the population og rosy apple aphids. It is therefore important that the garden or farm  consist of a great amount of different plant species to benefit the natural enemies. Besade several natural enemies, due to the rapid increases in pest populations during spring, their combined effect may not suffice to prevent economic damage to apples. The enemies do, however, reduce the pest populations. Most enemies are predators. Syrphidae often arrive first and are considered to be the most efficient. Others include Cecidomyiidae, Coccinellidae, Miridae and earwigs. ","In early spring, field observations should be regularly carried out. These will determine whether spraying is required.  Chemical control is applied frequently against D. plantaginea on apple, though it is usually not necessary against other aphids such as A. pomi and R. insertum. This aphid may be controlled with systemics if they are aimed at its infestation foci, early in the season. Applications of kaolin dust significantly reduced pest numbers, but not to below their economic injury level. Fluvalinate and thiamethoxam are currently used  abroad against D. plantaginea  pre-flowering; the more selective imidacloprid and pirimicarb are mostly used post-flowering. Even in commercial orchards where some insecticides are available, there has been greate difficulties controlling this specific aphid. Partly because the aphids are protected by a waxy layer and partly because they are hidden inside the curling leaves. Therefore the growers try to spray as soon as the aphids are observed.",,,"New shoots, which have been heavily infected, can be removed and destroyed. All agrotechnical measures that result in good health condition of fruit trees, negatively affect the number of your leaves. Intensive non-homogeneous fertilization, thick assembly, incorrect cutting and incorrect application of insecticides to suppress drug damage, which has led to a change in the balance between your leaves and their natural enemies, all of which causes an increased number of leafy. Also, the physical destruction of ant nests can reduce pest numbers by encouraging the natural enemies. Covering apple plots with codling moth exclusion nets reduced the duration of aphid infestations by 7 to 10 days, as well as reducing the abundance of ants in pest colonies. Also, removing the secondary host (plantain and dock). However you have to calculate that the aphids are able to fly a considerable distance or be transported by the wind.",
Aphids,Eriosoma lanigerum (Hausmann),Apple and plantain (Plantago lanceolate Linnaeus and P. major Linnaeus).,"Apperance and lifecycle: The bodies of the nymphs are pink, becoming darker as they mature. The apterous and alate females are grey-brown to black, with fluffy wax, the siphunculi and cauda are black; body length 1.8-2.5 mm.","Against E. lanigerum in Massachusetts (USA), standard inspection involves examination of five pruning cuts on one tree per 1.5 ha, with a provisional threshold for treatment of 50% infected pruning cuts.  In Western Europe, however, the suggested threshold is 8–12 colonies per 100 shoots. ","The lice colonies are found on roots, branches and stems, often in conjunction with pruning ulcers. Rod shots are also often a home of blood clots. Attacks do not normally damage the tree to a significant extent, but the secretion of sugars and the strong wax formation often give the fruits an unesthetically glued surface. However, in the case of strong attacks, cancerous gall formation may occur on the shoots, which may cause crumbling growth to some degree. Worse it is when these grids burst and opened up for direct access to the tree's interior. Attacks of gloeosporium and cancer can then occur and cause major damage to the trees. ",,"Fortunately, there are natural enemies for this pest. Parasitoids: Parasitoids are not very effective for aphids, though A. mali usually keeps E. lanigerum under biological control. A small sniper whale (Aphelinus mali) specialized in laying eggs in the bloodslots. The result of this is that a new nasal congestion is being developed instead of the bloodstream body. Parasitization of the blood clots with this snotting weapon is a very important contribution to the control and can often be seen in Danish orchards and in private gardens. The efficiency of A. mali can be promoted easily whenever necessary by bringing apple shoots containing mummified aphid colonies fromother orchards into the infested orchard, and the use of broad-spectrum pesticides on that crop can then be avoided. Parasitization by Aphelinus mali, which can keep E. lanigerum at a low level, can be promoted and preserved from destruction by avoiding or the judicious use of insecticides.","E.  lanigerum is normally kept under biological control, but chemical measures are sometimes necessary. Some effective systemic insecticides are chlorpyrifos, phosphamidon, pirimicarb, and demetonmethyl. ","Even though chlorpyrifos is highly effective, it is very toxic to A. mali; pirimicarb is more selective, but has low persistence. Therefore, in apple orchards under IPM programmes in New Zealand, mineral oil or oil and buprofezin are applied. ","Sprinkling with cold water and brush brushing can often completely eliminate attacks on certain trees in private gardens. An old advice is that in the wintertime you can use your fan / gas burner. However, care should be taken not to damage the bark .",,
Aphids,Rhopalosiphum insertum  (Walker),"Apple, pear and quince","Appearance and Lifecycle: When the wool layer is removed, the lenses are visible. The growing blood lice are parthegonetic females (feeding live kids without prior fertilization) They are 1.2 - 2.6 mm long, purple-colored reddish or brownish. The upper part of the body is covered with very small wax cuttings. The antennas are usually hexagonal, but 2 or more joints may be fused together. Mature males and females are somewhat smaller. Only about 1 mm is the body length of the females and about ½ mm in the males. ",,"Damage is due to direct feeding on the young leaves, shoots and buds. Most damage is caused in spring, when the flower buds are opening. Considerable crop yield losses can occur due to the constant sucking of sap, which decreases fruit set and can cause the premature fall of fruitlets. R. insertum is one of several aphid species responsible for considerable loss of crops annually, particularly in orchards that are not regularly sprayed.While the first generation can induce leaf curling, it is more commonly caused not by aphids, but by apple powdery mildew This is a serious disease which is normally controlled by application of fungicide. Large numbers of apple-grass aphid can induce leaf curling perpendicular to the mid-rib, but the tree seems to rapidly recover from the damage once the aphids move to grasses in May. ",EPPO economic treshold: 80% of the spurs with attack,"It is difficult to appraise the real importance of syrphids in respect to the apple-grass aphid. Some had the impression that they were not very important, as he found them in larger numbers only when the population density of the aphids was rather high. Some others however are less certain about this as early in the year we have observed quite heavily infested trees to be apparently 'cleansed' of aphids by small numbers of syrphid larvae. The presence of apple-grass aphid can even be beneficial, as it may encourage aphid natural enemies to build up in early spring, increasing chances of natural control of other pest aphids. Contrary to this point of view some considered that R. insertum was an important pest in Northern Irish apple orchards and recommended an economic spray threshold of 30 trusses infested per 25 trees during green cluster to pink bud stage. However, scientifics found that even when numbers in orchards in Northern Ireland exceeded recommended spray thresholds, there was no significant fruit loss. Moreover, numbers of apple-grass aphid were much higher in managed orchards where acaricide and aphicides were applied than in unmanaged orchards where only fungicides were used. ",,,,,

Scale infestation leads to purple discoloration around the calyx end of apple and pear. Heavy infestation on the bark may weaken the trees and reduce crop.  All surface parts of young host plant tissue are infested.  It infests mainly the bark and branches, occurring also on the fruit, which it discolors. A red halo-like spot (due to secreted toxins) appears on tender peach twigs within 24 hours of crawler settlement, the spot growing along with the pest. Infested tissues may crack and exude gum, followed by desiccation and die-back. Wounded, weakened branches may be attacked by wood-boring insects. Heavy infestations cause death of branches and even that of entire trees within a few years. The red cortical tissue swells with accumulating sap. This red coloration is not specific to Q. perniciosus; it has also been reported on Ligustrum infested by Q. ostreaeformis. Bark often cracks and exudes gum, resulting in a surrounding dark-brown gelatinous area. Heavy infestation causes cessation of growth and loss of yield.

It was established that there are several methods for monitoring and detection, like white sticky traps (for the males), suction traps (for the males and parasitoids). Pheromone traps collecting the males and parasitoids are the most widely used. Because of the quarantine requirements an economic threshold was not developed. However, in some countries (where there is no strict prohibition, like in Hungary or Russia) there is a special quarantine threshold, only 5% of the fruits can be infested with this scale. ","Economic losses due to D. ostreaeformis on different fruit tree crops are difficult to assess. The emerging crawlers infest mostly tree bark, stems and branches and sometimes early fruits. Heavy infestations may cause branches to die, the trees to lose vigour, and to curtain their productive lives. In addition, scale infestation of fruits results in red spots.

The additional release of different predators, and conserving the local natural enemies can increase the efficiency of control.","For a long time fumigation of seedlings was the most important means of preventing early infestation. For this purpose different chemicals were used, such as hydrogen cyanide, fostoxin or methylbromide.","Special integrated control projects have been developed against orchard pests including scale insects. These programmes propose the use of new, selective, non-toxic products (different types of juvenoids and chitin inhibitors, for example) against pests, which have a good effect against different groups of pests, including scale insects.

Methods in more recent use are ammonia traps to bait females and attractants (like trimedlure) for males. An example is the widely used McPhail trap. It consists of a bell-shaped receptacle open at the bottom containing an attractant along with a toxicant, that may continue to attract for 2-3 months. McPhail traps are also used for mass-trapping, as a “lure-and-kill” technique.

This is usually of little consequence in established orchards but is more important on nursery stocks and newly planted trees.Occasionally, very severe attacks occur in established orchards, notably Bramley. Photosynthetic leaf area is greatly reduced, sometimes by over 50%, and this adversely affects fruit size and fruit bud formation.",,"The parasitic wasp Platygaster demades is the key natural enemy of apple leaf midge and will reduce populations to low, tolerable levels if allowed to establish and thrive. The parasite occurs naturally in the UK but is often absent or present at only very low levels in commercial orchards as it is sensitive to broad-spectrum insecticides.",Chemical control of these midge species is difficult because their first reproductive periods coincide more or less with the flowering of their hosts when most insecticides cannot be applied and because insecticide residues are effective for only very short periods on fast-growing shoot tips while hatching larvae soon find protection inside the galls they produce.There are no approved plant protection products available for the control of this insect. ,"The parasitic wasp Platygaster demades is the key natural enemy of apple leaf midge and will reduce populations to low, tolerable levels if allowed to establish and thrive.

They are placed in groups on the leaf page (20-100 together) in a translucent egg mass. As they approach the hatch it is easier to spot. ","In order to reduce the numbers of the pest’s first generation, its populations are monitored in early spring. Sex pheromone traps (often using the Shin-Etsu twist-tie rope dispensers) are used to capture male moths in order to establish the biofix, which indicates the time of first male catch (beginning of the emergence from diapause). The development of the pest’s population may then be determined by using the PETE (Predictive Extension Time Estimator) model. By using information about the pest’s biology along with meteorological data, PETE forecasts when the various stages of the pest will appear, and thereby indicates the optimal time for spraying against its first generation. Later in the season pheromone traps are used to monitor moth populations; the finding of 4 or more moths per trap within two weeks triggers chemical control measures. Another method, used later in the season to determine the results of control measures, consists of establishing the rate of fruit infestation, samples being collected every week or during the population peaks of the moth. Individual apples are examined for the presence of dark brown frass, which is the excrement of the larva.","The first damage is seen on young owners in the form of tinting and drying.

Beneficial organisms are not sufficient by themselves to affect a commercially acceptable level of control; rather, they play a potentially potent part in an overall long-range ecological management strategy. Best results are usually observed after three to five years of releases, as the population of beneficials grows. ","Chemical spray treatment is widely used for the control of C. pomonella. Chemical control of  C. pomonella. is one of the best documented topics in the applied entomological literature. The key element is accurate timing of the first treatment. This can be refined by pheromone trapping of the first flight of adults. Mating requires two consecutive evenings at a temperature over 15°C. Eggs are laid over 5-6 days and have to incubate over 8-18 days. A simple temperature sum curve can be used to estimate when the eggs will hatch. The first treatment can then be timed just before egg hatch (except diflubenzuron to be applied during oviposition). Computer-based prognosis models are available, generally used by the official forecasting services. In northern Europe, the second generation can also be timed but, in southern Europe, the generations rapidly come to overlap. In summer, thresholds can also be used to decide whether to treat (% infested fruits, numbers of adults caught in pheromone traps).","In Denmark, You can use:

When the larvae drill into the apples, there is often a certain amount of juice that solidifies into a white mass. These early symptoms are characteristic of this particular pest. The skull around this attack will then darken and shrink. After a week, the larvae begin to go deeper into the apples and leave winding brownish times with a cross-section of between 1 and 1.5 mm. The larvae continue their work and eventually reach the core house, destroying the protein rich diet. When the larvae are full grown, they leave the fruit through a slightly broader passage ending with a small extension just before the exit hole. From here they are firing down to the ground.

Often, much of the knowledge on the mechanisms behind insect host-plant location via volatiles remains confined to the laboratory. A gap is reported when transferring the knowledge gained in laboratory into a natural setting. Our talk offers an example of a combined approach with laboratory and field bioassays to develop an IPM system based on plant volatiles. We predicted that the background odour of the crop and the way of delivery of plant volatiles could be key factors in closing this gap. We tested this hypothesis on the system of Argyresthia conjugella, the apple fruit moth, and its host-plants (Sorbus aucuparia and Malus domestica). Results showed that the delivery system as well as the volatile background had a great influence on attraction of plant volatile lures. Both were relevant to successfully transfer the preliminary data obtained in the laboratory into a field setting. By taking these factors into consideration, a monitoring lure to track the apple fruit moth migration from rowan to apple was developed. ",,,

Moths,Synanthedon myopaeformis  (Borkhausen),Apple,"Life cycle: The moths occur in the orchards from May to November, dependent upon temperatures, host plant and plant protection practices. A female lives about one week, depositing 100-300 eggs on the bark, mostly on the tree from which it had emerged, or nearby. The emerging larvae bore into young twigs, often at the leaf bases, bringing about the withering on a leaf growing underneath. The larvae then move into elder, thicker branches wherein they continue to borrow into the wood, completing their development there. The pattern of the excavated tunnels differs between trees. In hosts like deciduous fruit trees, the tunnels are straight, whereas in other trees, like olives, the tunnels may be circular or sinuous. Prior to pupation the mature larva bores an emergence hole near the original point of ingress, and seals it by a thin membrane. The young adults break through and emerge.

Surveys of the parasitoids of leaf-mining moths have been done in many countries. The larvae were exploited easily by a large number of parasitoid species over evolutionary time because they are relatively immobile and are protected poorly by their mines. In general, these showed each leaf mining species to be attacked by a complex often of over ten species of parasitoid, though usually 2-3 species were numerically dominant. Several parasitoid species have more than one host.

The females of some populations are red, and known as the carmine spider mite (Tetranychus cinnabarinus (Boisduval).",,"The grass turns yellow. Large totter, later large flakes can be pulled up without the greater resistance. A well-trained eye is able to see at an early stage where the larvae are just in color crests in the grassy field. It is important when a fight is to be inserted, as it is often not possible to treat the entire lawn. Under the grass there are larvae, in some cases up to 100 in a single spot. In some cases the adult beetles can also cause damage. In apple orchards on the lighter fields, often the fruits of the fruit are often seen. The attacks are most often seen on the lighter, sandy and porous fields. There are thus many reports from the Jutland region.

Sawflies,Aculus schlechtendali  (Nalepa) ,Apple,"Life history: At 25-30°C a generation may be raised in about two weeks, each female laying over 100 eggs. The mite, which lives in colonies, develops through five stages: egg, larva, two nymphs and adults. Before its last molt the mite covers itself with a few webs that emit a sex pheromone. The attracted males (which develop slightly faster) wait around the molting female and may fight amongst themselves, the winner pushing the loser(s) away; mating takes place as soon as the female frees itself from the webs. Optimal conditions for reproduction and for webbing are at about 25°C and 40% relative humidity (RH). Females disperse between plants and sites by ballooning, becoming detached from the hosts and blown about by winds. Females undergo a winter diapause, turn pink-orange (due to accumulated lipids), hide in debris in the top layers of the soil or in sheltered sites, and lay no eggs until next spring. The red form has no diapause, reproducing the year around. The webs are used to construct and define the mite colony, to protect it from predators and from unsuitable humidities (the TSSM has only a few progeny at 0% RH and none at 100% RH), to discourage competitors, for dispersal and as a carrier of the sex pheromone.",,,,"Chemical methods have been supplemented by increasingly well understood biological control strategies involving predatory stigmaeid and phytoseid mites. Predatory mites being the most efficient antagonists of A. schlechtendali, these should be preserved by choosing compatible plant protection products during the whole season.",,Research on control of the apple rust mite has focused increasingly on maintaining integrated management by balancing use of biological and chemical agents. ,,,
Mites,Panonychus ulmi (Koch),"More than 50 plant species, mostly Rosaceae, but also grape vines, walnut and others, including ornamentals","Appearance and Lifecycle: The mites are quite small, from 0.1-0.2 mm long. They are light or light reddish. The shape is long-sleeved and spits a little towards the back end. The eggs are white and oval, approx. 0.05 mm long. ",,"Mite feeding causes leaves to lighten in colour, becoming mottled and stippled. Heavy infestations cause leaf bronzing, drying of leaves and premature leaf fall. Tree growth is reduced, which impairs fruit ripening as well as the yield of the following year by reducing fruit-bud set.  In the business table, this mite has often caused major problems. Symptoms are yellow- / bronze-colored leaves that fall off earlier than normal during heavy attacks. The result is reduced photosynthesis and consequently poorer fruit quality.  Pest effect on apple yield (quantity and quality) depends on the affected cultivar, and is greater when the trees are suffering from water stress. The problems have often been greatest in cases where large quantities of chemical agents have been used because these have destroyed the natural enemies. ",,"The basic principle of its suppression in IPM is maintaining the balance between the spider and its naturale nemies. Useful mites are easily entered, but must be careful not to be destroyed wide spectrum insecticides (Nauen et al., 2001). It's a natural balance established if there is one predatory mite on 10 to 20 red specimensfruit spider. ","The pest’s larvae and young nymphs are quite susceptible to pesticides, thus spraying in the spring, as the diapause eggs are hatching, would give best results. To obtain suitable data twigs may be kept in a covered shed in the field and egg hatching observed until approximately half had emerged, which would be the best time for spraying. It is often recommended that chemical sprayss should not be initiated before the mite has accumulated 150 ACMDs. The pest may be controlled with many acaricides, but has developed much resistance to most pesticides. Avermectins and propargite provided good mite control in Syria. Pyrethroids encourage outbreaks of the European red mite. Chemical spray treatments every spring are only recommended if theoverwintering population exceeds economic treshold of 1000-2000 eggs per 2 m fruit spur. During spring and summer, sprays are necessary only if 60% of the leaves are infested. If predatory mites are present, a higher percentage can be tolerated.

Mites,Tetranychus urticae  Koch,"Over 200 host plants, with a preference for legumes.",,"In cotton, collecting 100 leaves at random and tallying the rate of leaves infested by mites, their cast skins and webbing, from early in the season on, will supply data on the progress of the infestation. Similar methods are in use on other crops. Early TSSM damage to greenhouse pepper leaves can be detected spectrally by the reflectance of the visible and near-infrared regions of damaged leaves.","The TSSM usually colonizes the lower side of leaves, where they feed by sucking sucking the juice into the leaves and fruits. The leaves are first noticed by small whitish spots. Later the sheet changes color in reddish, dries and collapses. Such feeding causes reducing the quantity and quality of the crop. The fruits are deformed, they are lagging behind and they grow old. In the event of a strong attack, the entire plant is blocked. The plants first appear in the plant, and then the pest quickly spreads and can be destroyed for the entire time. Severe infestations of trees results in defoliation during the summer and autumn. Damage to ornamentals is seen as browning and withering of petals. Affected cotton leaves become dark-red. When infesting apples, leaves become mottled and drop. Some damage is caused by the webbing that may cover parts of plants and impedes biological and chemical control. Until the end of World War II T. urticae was seldom considered to be a major pest, most of its damage seen in late summer and autumn. ",,"European red mite is usually maintained below its economic injury level by natural enemies; there is evidence that pest outbreaks often follow the application of indiscriminate pesticides. This suggests that the careful use of selective pesticides, which do not harm the natural enemies, would be the key to European red mite management. Abroad the pest is controlled by various Phytoseiidae. In Israel the mite is often kept below its economic injury threshold by endemic predators, especially Typhlodromus athiasae Porath and Swirski. Species of the coccinellid Stethorus sp. also kill the pest, although this predator often arrives after the pest has already caused much damage. The entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) caused over 80% mite mortality in Egypt.",Tetranychus urticae when attacks apple and pear can be treated in exactly the same way as  Panonychus ulmi.,,,,

In seedlings injured by the mite, bark is hardly scaled off during bud grafting, and grafted buds do not survive. Moreover, it causes mass leaf drying in seedling farms and young gardens, sharply hampering the physiological state of plants. In fruit-producing gardens, the mite damages also flowerbuds, ovaries and fruits, provoking their decease and falling out during strong infestation. Due to the hidden way of life, even the intensive treatments hardly make its harmfulness economically insensible.
